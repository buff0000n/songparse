	# 1 indicates that note is filled, 0 means it's blank.
	# The next 13 bits are the second vertical column in the first measure.  This continues
	# for all 64 columns.
	# This is probably convenient for playback, but the binary data columns and rows are 
	# reversed compared to how the note data appears in the game.  I need to reverse the rows
	# and columns, and the easiest way was to just build a random bit access method getBit()
